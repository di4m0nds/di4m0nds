Hi there! I am a software developer currently working at a consulting company. I hold an associate degree in Web Development from Universidad Nacional de San Luis, where I honed my skills and gained a strong foundation in software development. My passion for developing innovative solutions that meet the needs of clients and businesses led me to pursue a career in this field. I have a keen interest in staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and advancements in software development. In my free time, I love to delve into the world of science and explore new technologies. I believe that continuous learning is crucial to growth and success, both professionally and personally.
